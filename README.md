# Burglar-Alarm
The theme of the project is a burglar alarm that uses a light sensor as a motion sensor.
In addition, we use the accelerometer as a sensor that protects the object against an attempt to interfere with the device. Program menu
controlled by the tact switch 4x4 keyboard and displayed on the LCD1602 display. Have been introduced
special security in the form of arming and disarming the alarm with code. The menu has been divided into a mode
administrator and user with a suitable password for them, which can be changed. User functionality
has been limited to arming / disarming the alarm and changing its password, while the administrator has
additional functionalities such as enabling / disabling the Bluetooth module and setting the current date and
hours (RTC). Using the application downloaded on the phone, which acts as a terminal, and by connecting to the module
bluetooth HC-06 can arm / disarm our alarm through our smartphone. The burglary signaling remained
implemented on LEDs and siren (DDS generator).
